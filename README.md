# IT Bot

IT Bot with multiple dialogs, a QnA service, and barcode scanner functionality.

Each "channel" has its own nuances and sometimes various pieces of code need to be modified.  

- This sample includes the Teams channel in it's own branch "Code Mofified For Teams".  The original code includes the ability to access an image locally which is fine for the simulator - whereas the Teams code does not use any local code.
- The "dev" branch includes features in-progress.
